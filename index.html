        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p class="lead">Construction, demolition and excavation (CD&E) generated over half of total UK waste in 2014.</p>
        <p>Our team has been tasked with finding ways to reduce the consumption of energy in the lifetime of buildings. The UK government reports that around 90% of construction waste is successfully recycled [1], however the energy consumption for recycling construction waste is high. Instead of focusing on treating waste, our team will focus on minimizing waste and energy consumption, during the construction processes. Around 15% of the volume of materials used is wasted during the construction process. If optimized, less waste would be generated, which would increase the recycling rate, but decrease the energy for logistics and production[2].</p>

        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>
            The solution is prefabricated construction. For the traditional method, there are 6 steps in which the main structure of the house is built onsite. While for prefab, there are only 4, because the components are manufactured offsite, then will be sent to the site and installed. The skeletons of prefab houses are usually made of solid steel. This gives a variety of potential materials for the panels including concrete, wood, straw bale or even bamboo. The concrete panels, for example, are connected using a mechanism called “anchor” members and “ring” members, both are cylindrical steel plates that are embedded into the panels, they fit into each other and welded together.

        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p class="lead">The state of prefabrication in the UK.</p>
        <p>The UK construction industry underperforms in 4 areas: productivity, certainty in delivery, skills shortages, data transparency
           Therefore, to improve in all of these aspects, we really believe PreFab buildings can transform the UK’s construction delivery performance.
           A study by the UK Commision for Employment and Skills stated that offsite construction was 7% of the total construction sector in 2009
          However, KPMG findings show that net financial project savings of 7% are possible with offsite construction due to the shortened construction length and thus shows the certified advantages with this approach.
          However, with little encouragement and incentives to maximise PreFab in the UK, the industry is failing to make these bigger leaps and therefore we would like to further implement this.</p>

        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <p class="lead">Better production and evergy efficiency, lower construction time.</p>
        <p>
          Using prefabricated building as a solution to reduce construction waste would offer several benefits.
          <br/>It is estimated that, using off-site and modular building, would improve efficiency in construction up to 50% thanks to a more rigorous and controlled production line that would eliminate the issues related to on-site manufacturing. 
          Furthermore, a rigorous offsite production line would lead to up to 30% improvement in energy efficiency of this type of buildings due to a more airtight manufacturing.
            Construction time would also be reduced as the production on-site phase would be eliminated and performed in much more efficient off-site factories.
           Finally the overall cost of construction would be reduced by 10 to 12%.

        <h1>Constraints</h1>

        <p>Like every project, this one carries risks and constraints. The biggest one being public perception. When people hear prefabricated they think the ugly soviet style construction of the post world war two years. But now people have all the time in the world to work with designers to get the home they like.</p>

        <h1>Adoption Timeline</h1>
        <p class="lead">A breakdown time analysis of the adoption of our solution.</p>
        <p>You may be wondering, what is the timeline of prefabrication? 

            Well, first you must register the building. Following this, you need to get a factory - there are lots in the north and Scotland which can be rented or bought and fitted with the equipment. You also need to meet all regulations in regards to planning permits, material safety and worker safety.
            
            After all this, you can start to build the first home. From design, to construction in factory, to the final build on the land, this will only take 9 months - almost half the time current builds of a similar scale take.
            
            This is why prefabrication is the way forward!</p>
